This is the configuration for launching a hedonometer development server, from scratch-ish.

With vagrant and virtual box installed, just go ahead and `Vagrant up` in this directory and you should see the site at `localhost:8080/index.html`.
Go in and change whatever, and when satisfied, push to github, and get out of the VM and run the deploy.yml playbook from this directory.
